    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>“The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated.” – Mahatma Gandhi</p>
    <p>Welcome to Animal Rescue Portal, a platform created with the goal of making it easier to report and support stray animals in need of medical assistance.</p>
    <p>Our mission is to connect rescuers, volunteers, and donors to ensure that every animal receives the care and attention it deserves.</p>

    <h2>Why this platform matters!</h2>
    <p>Stray animals often go unnoticed or untreated due to a lack of resources or awareness. Our platform bridges the gap between people who want to help and animals that desperately need assistance.</p>
    <p>By creating a trusted platform for reporting and fundraising, we make it easier to provide immediate care for animals in distress.</p>
    <p>JOIN US in our mission to give a voice to those who can't speak for themselves and help create a better, kinder world for animals.</p>
