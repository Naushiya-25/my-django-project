        <p>Street animals, such as stray dogs and cats, often face a harsh and challenging life. They struggle to survive in environments that are not designed to support them, dealing with threats such as hunger, disease, and hostile human interactions.</p>

        <h2>Key challenges they face:</h2>
        <h3>1. Lack of Food and Water:</h3>
        <p>One of the biggest struggles for street animals is the constant search for food and water. Many animals survive by scavenging from garbage or receiving food from kind individuals, but this is often not enough to maintain a healthy life.</p>

        <h3>2. Health Issues:</h3>
        <p>Stray animals are frequently exposed to various diseases, injuries, and parasites. Without regular medical care or vaccinations, they are vulnerable to life-threatening conditions.</p>

        <h3>3. Weather Conditions:</h3>
        <p>Extreme weather, such as intense heat, freezing cold, or heavy rains, adds another layer of difficulty for street animals. Without proper shelter, they are often left exposed to the elements, which can lead to health complications or even death.</p>

        <h3>4. Abuse and Neglect:</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately, many street animals suffer abuse or mistreatment from humans. Some people see them as a nuisance and harm them physically. Others simply ignore their suffering, passing them by without offering help.</p>

        <h3>5. Overpopulation:</h3>
        <p>Uncontrolled breeding is a major issue among street animals, leading to overpopulation. Many strays give birth in dangerous or unsanitary conditions, and their offspring often face the same challenges as their parents. This contributes to a cycle of suffering and increases the number of animals living on the streets.</p>

        <h3>6. Lack of Medical Attention:</h3>
        <p>Street animals rarely have access to veterinary care. This means that even minor injuries or illnesses can become life-threatening. Conditions like mange, infections, malnutrition, and untreated wounds are common.</p>
